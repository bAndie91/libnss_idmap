# user with uid=1000 will be shown as he has uid=2000
uid 1000 to 2000

# same goes for GIDs
gid 1234 to 5432

# mapping based on names
user john to 1234
group accounting to 4000

# range mapping is also supported
# here uid 2000 goes to 3000, 2001 to 3001, etc, 2100 to 3100
uid 2000-2100 to 3000-
gid 1100-1499 to 1500-

# don't show user with uid=2000
# this is useful to prevent two users with the same UID
uid 1000 to 2000
uid 2000 hide

# you can swap two UIDs
uid 1000 to 2000
uid 2000 to 1000

# let the replacement UID be a file's owner UID
uid 1000 as /home/{NAME} or retain
# these template variables are supported:
#   {NAME} substitutes to the user/group name
#   {ID} substitutes to the user/group ID
uid 1000 as /etc/nss.d/idmap.d/uid/{ID} or retain
gid 1000 as /etc/nss.d/idmap.d/gid/{ID} or retain

# if the file is not found (or can not be stat(2)'ed),
# then do not do mapping, just keep the UID
uid 1234 as /home/{NAME} or retain

# if the file is not found, then hide the queried user
uid 1234 as /home/{NAME} or hide

# if the file is not found, then ignore this rule 
# and continue processing further mapping rules
uid 1234 as /home/{NAME} or ignore
